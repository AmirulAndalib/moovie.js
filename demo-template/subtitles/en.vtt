4

i understand.

5
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.440
You wann get out of here?

6
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.480
Our rebellion is all that is left to fight the Empire.

7
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.200
We think you can help us.

8
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.820
When was the last time you have seen your father?

9
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.960
What is this?

10
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.700
Apparently he is critical for the development of a super weapon.

11
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.880
If my father built this thing ...

12
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.420
we need to find him.

13
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.700
All right.

14
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.980
How many do we need?

15
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.580
They are requestion a codename.

16
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.620
its...

17
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.180
Rogue

18
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.540
Rogue One.

19
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.920
The power we're dealing with here ...

20
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.720
it is immeasurable.

21
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.680
If the Empire has that kind of power ...

22
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.320
what chance will we have?

23
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.500
We have hope.

24
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.420
Rebellions are formed by hope.

25
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.600
They have no idea that we're coming.

26
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.480
Keep this moment.

27
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.320
The Force is powerful.

28
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.900
Makes ten men look like a hundred.

29
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.740
We will take the next chance.

30
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.700
And the next.

31
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.980
They're all rebels, aren't they?

32
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.880
Save the Rebellion!

33
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.580
Save the Dream!
